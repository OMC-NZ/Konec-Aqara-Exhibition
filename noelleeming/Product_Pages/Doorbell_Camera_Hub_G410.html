                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Experience crystal-clear 2K video, intelligent detection, and full smart home control – all in one powerful device. The G410 Select uses advanced mmWave radar and facial recognition to deliver accurate alerts, helping you avoid false alarms.</p><br>
                    <p>With built-in Zigbee, Thread, and Matter support, it seamlessly connects your entire smart home ecosystem. Your footage stays safe thanks to end-to-end encryption, while expandable local storage allows for continuous 24/7 recording.</p><br>
                    <p>Compatible with Apple HomeKit Secure Video and a wide range of third-party devices, the G410 Select lets you see who’s at your door and control your locks, lights, and security – all with complete privacy.</p><br>
                    <p>One smart doorbell. Total home control.</p><br>
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Aqara, HomeKit, Matter and Other Ecosystem Support: </b>The Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 works seamlessly with major smart home ecosystems, including Apple HomeKit, Matter, Google Home, Alexa, and SmartThings. Enjoy secure, end-to-end encrypted video storage with HomeKit Secure Video using your existing iCloud plan.<br>With support for RTSP and advanced Matter bridging, you’ll get improved integration with platforms like Home Assistant—including local streaming, local automations (like face recognition via Aqara Home Signals), and powerful condition-based triggers. No matter your setup, the G410 offers smooth, multi-platform integration.</li>
                        <li><b>A Central Hub for Aqara & Matter Devices: </b>The G410 doubles as a high-performance hub for both Aqara Zigbee and Matter devices. It not only connects your Aqara gear, but also brings third-party Matter devices into the Aqara Home app—supporting one of the most extensive Matter device ranges on the market, including the latest types many other hubs don’t yet support.</li>
                        <li><b>Intelligent Detection with Privacy at the Core: </b>Built-in mmWave radar provides highly accurate motion detection while helping to conserve battery life. On-device facial recognition allows for personalised alerts—without relying on the cloud, subscriptions, or an internet connection. If tampered with, the device sounds a siren and begins recording automatically thanks to tamper-proof screws.</li>
                        <li><b>Flexible & Secure Storage Options: </b>The Aqara Doorbell Camera Hub G410 gives you peace of mind with multiple storage choices:<br>

                                o Cloud: Encrypted cloud storage via the Aqara HomeGuardian plan keeps your videos private and accessible only to you.</li>
                        <li><b>Powerful 95 dB Built-In Chime: </b>Forget extra chime boxes. The integrated 95 dB speaker plays custom ringtones and pre-recorded voice messages. Powered by USB-C, it supports flexible placement and easy backup via mini UPS. Loud customizable audio and versatile power—no extra hardware needed.</li>
                        <li><b>2K Ultra-Clear Video with Wide-Angle View: </b>With a 2K resolution, 4:3 aspect ratio, and a 175° wide-angle lens, the G410 lets you see everything happening on your doorstep. Its f/1.8 aperture ensures crisp footage—even at night. Complete porch coverage with crystal-clear detail, day and night.</li>
                        <li><b>Dual Power Options for Flexibility: </b>Run it on six AA batteries or hardwire it to your existing doorbell system. Ideal for renters or homeowners, it also includes a battery backup for power outages. Radar tech ensures battery life lasts up to 5 months. Flexible installation, reliable power, consistent performance.</li>
                        <li><b>Reliable Dual-Band Wi-Fi & Enterprise-Grade Security: </b>Supports both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks to reduce interference, especially in busy apartment blocks. Enhanced WPA3 security protects against Wi-Fi intrusions. Stable connectivity with enterprise-grade security.</li>
                        <li><b>Privacy & Family Safety Features: Stay in control with advanced privacy tools:</b><br>
                                o Privacy Masking: Permanently block out sensitive areas from recordings.<br>
                                o Voice Changer: Choose from four voice profiles to protect children and older family members.<br>
                                o Integrated Control: Unlock doors and stream video directly to your displays using the Aqara Home app.<br>
                            Complete security, privacy, and smart home convenience in one solution designed for modern families worldwide.</li>
                        <li><b>Free 3-Month Cloud Storage Trial: </b>Your G410 Select comes with a complimentary 3-month trial of Aqara’s HomeGuardian cloud service. Explore AI features and gain extra storage to enhance your overall experience from day one.</li>

                    <p id="additional-notes">
                        Note:<br>
                        * HomeKit Requirements: Requires iCloud plan and Apple home hub. Within Apple Home, video resolution is limited to 1200p and may adjust based on network conditions. When both Apple Home and Aqara Home are active, Aqara resolution is also capped at 1200p. Full 2K is restored when HomeKit is disconnected.<br>
                        ** Matter Compatibility: G410 acts as a Matter bridge and supports RTSP only when powered via cable.<br>

                        **** Recording Conditions: MicroSD card is not included. Continuous 24/7 recording is available only in wired mode.<br>
                        ***** Cloud Plan: HomeGuardian plan is required for cloud storage beyond the free trial, and activates automatically.<br>
                        ****** Power Supply: USB power adapter not included.<br>
                        ******* Battery Life Disclaimer: Based on an average of 10 wake-ups per day. Battery life may vary based on traffic and environment. In high-traffic areas, we recommend using power-saving mode.<br>
